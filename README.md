### Additional folders for STM32CubeIDE


### Memory sections
  - The [linker script](/STM32CubeIDE/STM32H723ZGTX_FLASH.ld) with a description of the regions
  - "Heap" and "Stack" area are placed in the "DTCMRAM" section
  - The file [Hermes-compiler.c](/Components/Hermes/Sources/Hermes-compiller.h) has been added, which includes definitions of memory areas for tasks, arrays and structures. The file also contains a macros for determining the packaging of structures
  - The MTU is also configured for the correct operation of the DMA with the "RAM_D1" and "RAM_D2" sections

### LWIP
  - General
    - The FreeRTOS-Plus-TCP stack has been replaced with LWIP, which is included in the "STM32CubeMX" program makes it easy to configure and there are many examples of use
  - Features of use
    - For correct transmission and reception of data, they must be located in the memory sections "RAM_D1" or "RAM_D2" otherwise a DMA error will be caused
